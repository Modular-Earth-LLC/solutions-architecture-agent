   # Claude loads CLAUDE.md and .claude/ automatically
   ```

---

## How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions

#### 1. Agent Improvements

**Improve existing agents** using specialized improvement prompts:

- Use `user_prompts/self_improvement/improve_[agent]_agent.user.prompt.md`
- Follow the agent-specific improvement guidance
- Test thoroughly before submitting PR
- Document changes in agent version history

**Example workflow:**
```bash
# In Claude Code CLI, reference the improvement prompt:
# "Use user_prompts/self_improvement/improve_optimization_agent.user.prompt.md"
# Make improvements
# Test all affected workflows
# Submit PR with test results
```

#### 2. User Prompt Enhancements

**Add new user prompts** or improve existing ones:

- Place in appropriate category (`user_prompts/[category]/`)
- Use naming convention: `[task_name].user.prompt.md`
- Do NOT include version/date metadata (centralized in `.repo-metadata.json`)
- Reference relevant knowledge base files
- Test with target agent

**Template for new user prompts:**
```markdown
# [Task Name] - User Prompt

**Purpose:** [What this prompt does]  
**Agent:** [Which agent uses this]  
**Inputs:** [Required inputs]  
**Output:** [Expected deliverable]

---

[Detailed instructions...]

---

**Version:** 1.0  
**Purpose:** [Brief description]  
**Category:** [Category name]  
**Agent:** [Agent name]
```

#### 3. Documentation Updates

**Improve guides, examples, or explanations:**

- Fix typos or clarity issues
- Add missing examples
- Update outdated information
- Improve navigation and cross-references

**Key documentation:**
- `README.md` - System overview
- `docs/getting-started.md` - First-time user guide
- `docs/workflow_guide.md` - Complete workflows
- `docs/agent-architecture-and-collaboration.md` - Agent details

#### 4. Knowledge Base Enhancements

**Improve JSON schemas or templates:**

- Enhance JSON Schema definitions in `knowledge_base/schemas/`
- Improve documentation in `knowledge_base/README.md`
- Add validation examples
- Ensure Well-Architected Framework alignment

#### 5. Templates and Examples

**Add reusable templates:**

- Create in `templates/` directory
- Use for common patterns (security checklists, testing plans, etc.)
- Include clear instructions and examples
- Reference from relevant agents

#### 6. Bug Fixes

**Report and fix issues:**

- Search existing issues first
- Create detailed bug report with reproduction steps
- Include system environment (Claude Code CLI version, OS, etc.)
- Submit fix with test demonstrating resolution

---

## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy

```bash
# Create feature branch from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Or for bug fixes
git checkout -b fix/issue-description
```

### Making Changes

1. **Make focused changes** - One logical change per PR
2. **Test thoroughly** - Validate affected workflows end-to-end
3. **Update documentation** - Keep docs synchronized with changes
4. **Add version info** - Update version headers where applicable
5. **Write clear commits** - Use conventional commits format

### Conventional Commits

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for clear change history:

```bash
# Format: <type>(<scope>): <description>

# Examples:
git commit -m "feat(requirements-agent): add industry-specific discovery templates"
git commit -m "fix(knowledge-base): correct JSON schema validation errors"
git commit -m "docs(getting-started): clarify Claude Code CLI setup steps"
git commit -m "refactor(optimization-agent): extract instrumentation guide"
git commit -m "test(agents): add end-to-end workflow validation"
```

**Commit Types:**
- `feat`: New feature or capability
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `refactor`: Code restructuring without behavior change
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks (dependencies, configs)

---

## Style Guidelines

### Agent Prompts (`.system.prompt.md`)

**Structure Requirements:**
- Use XML-style tags for sections: `<role>`, `<context>`, `<capabilities>`, `<guidelines>`, `<guardrails>`
- Include version footer: `**Version:** X.Y | **Last Updated:** YYYY-MM-DD | **Status:** Production-Ready`
- Reference `knowledge_base/system_config.json` for Well-Architected Framework definitions
- Use `<thinking>` tags for internal reasoning examples
- Provide concrete examples with financial operations as primary use case

**Prompt Engineering Best Practices:**
- Clear role definition
- Structured instructions (numbered steps, bullet lists)
- Concrete examples (show, don't just tell)
- Chain-of-thought reasoning patterns
- Error handling guidance
- Platform-agnostic design

### User Prompts (`.user.prompt.md`)

**Structure Requirements:**
- Clear purpose statement at top
- Specify which agent uses this prompt
- List required inputs and expected outputs
- Include version footer with metadata
- Reference knowledge base files when needed

**Best Practices:**
- Task-specific (one prompt = one focused task)
- Self-contained (minimal dependencies)
- Testable (clear success criteria)
- Reusable (generalizable beyond single use case)

### JSON Files

**Formatting:**
- 2-space indentation
- Include `$schema` reference at top
- Add `_comment` fields for documentation
- Use semantic versioning for schemas
- Validate against JSON Schema before committing

**Example:**
```json
{
  "$schema": "./schemas/system_config.schema.json",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "_comment": "This field explains purpose"
}
```

### Markdown Documentation

**Standards:**
- Use clear, descriptive headings
- Include table of contents for long documents (>200 lines)
- Code blocks with language specification (```python, ```bash)
- Internal links for navigation
- External links for references
- Keep line length reasonable (<120 characters preferred)

### Versioning Conventions

**Semantic Versioning (agents and schemas):**
- **Major (X.0)**: Breaking changes, significant refactoring
- **Minor (x.Y)**: New features, backward-compatible improvements
- **Patch (x.y.Z)**: Bug fixes, documentation updates (for schemas only)

**Agent Versions:**
- Use X.Y format (e.g., 1.0, 1.1, 2.0)
- Update when changing capabilities or structure
- Document changes in commit message

**User Prompt Versions:**
- Start at 1.0
- Increment when workflow changes
- Document updates in git history

---

## Special Contribution Areas

### 1. Self-Improvement Contributions

**Improving agents in THIS repository:**

Use the specialized improvement prompts in `user_prompts/self_improvement/`:
- Load appropriate improvement prompt with Optimization Agent or Prompt Engineering Agent
- Follow the guided improvement process
- Test thoroughly (meta-changes require extra validation)
- Document in PR: "Meta-improvement - tested with [scenarios]"

**Recursion Safety:**
- Self-improvement prompts have iteration limits
- Never modify recursion guardrails without team discussion
- Test meta-changes in isolated branch first

### 2. Well-Architected Contributions

**Enhancing AWS Well-Architected alignment:**

- All changes to `knowledge_base/system_config.json` → `aws_well_architected_framework` section require careful review
- This is the authoritative source for all agents
- Changes impact all agents that reference it
- Include rationale and AWS documentation links

**6 Pillars Coverage:**
- Operational Excellence
- Security
- Reliability
- Performance Efficiency
- Cost Optimization
- Sustainability

### 3. Security Contributions

**Security enhancements especially welcome:**

- Prompt injection protection patterns
- Input validation examples
- Security testing procedures
- Compliance checklists
- Refer to `templates/security-checklist.md` for current standards

**Security Fix Priority:**
- Security issues get expedited review
- Include severity assessment (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- Provide remediation guidance
- Reference OWASP LLM Top 10 or similar standards

**Sensitive Data Protection:**
- Use `private/` directory for any sensitive development content
- Review `private/README.md` for comprehensive security guidelines
