# Knowledge Base - Shared Data Store

**Purpose:** Centralized JSON storage for requirements, decisions, and configuration  
**Format:** JSON (better parsing and validation than YAML)

---

## Overview

The knowledge base is the "memory" of the Multi-Agent AI Development Framework.

```
Requirements Agent → WRITES user_requirements.json
                         ↓
Architecture Agent → READS user_requirements.json
                   → WRITES design_decisions.json
                         ↓
Engineering Agent → READS both files
                  → BUILDS prototype
                         ↓
Deployment Agent → READS design_decisions.json
                 → DEPLOYS system

All Agents → READ system_config.json (platform settings, constraints)
```

---

## Files

### 1. `system_config.json` (READ-ONLY)

**Purpose:** Platform settings, constraints, team information  
**Updated by:** You (manually)  
**Used by:** All agents

**Key sections:**
- Project info, platform, stakeholders
- Constraints (budget, timeline, compliance)
- Team (size, skills, gaps)
- Risk tolerance

**When to update:** Project start, when constraints change, team changes

---

### 2. `user_requirements.json`

**Purpose:** Requirements gathered during discovery  
**Written by:** Requirements Agent  
**Read by:** All downstream agents

**Key sections:**
- Customer context and use case
- Business problem and value
- Technical requirements
- Financial projections
- Risks and mitigation

**Lifecycle:** Created by Requirements Agent, updated during architecture, version controlled

---

### 3. `design_decisions.json`

**Purpose:** Architecture decisions, estimates, costs, plans  
**Written by:** Architecture Agent  
**Read by:** Engineering Agent, Deployment Agent

**Key sections:**
- Executive summary
- Tech stack and architecture
- Team composition
- Estimates and costs
- Project plan
- Risks and compliance

**Lifecycle:** Created through 6-step design process, updated during implementation

---

## Agent Access Patterns

**Requirements Agent:**
- READ: system_config.json
- WRITE: user_requirements.json

**Architecture Agent:**
- READ: system_config.json, user_requirements.json
- WRITE: design_decisions.json

**Engineering Agent:**
- READ: user_requirements.json, design_decisions.json
- UPDATE: design_decisions.json (implementation learnings)

**Deployment Agent:**
- READ: design_decisions.json

**Optimization Agent:**
- READ: All files
- UPDATE: Any file (based on findings)

---

## Starting a New Project

**Step 1:** Edit `system_config.json` with your project info, constraints, team

**Step 2:** Run Requirements Agent → populates `user_requirements.json`

**Step 3:** Run Architecture Agent → populates `design_decisions.json`

**Step 4:** Review both JSON files for completeness before building

---

## Validation

**Online validators:**
- JSONLint: https://jsonlint.com/

**Command-line (Python):**
```bash
python -m json.tool knowledge_base/user_requirements.json
```

**Automated:**
```bash
python scripts/validate_knowledge_base.py
```

---

## Version Control Best Practices

**Commit frequently:**
```bash
# After Requirements Agent
git add knowledge_base/user_requirements.json
git commit -m "Add requirements for [project]"

# After each Architecture step
git add knowledge_base/design_decisions.json
git commit -m "Complete tech stack selection"
```

**Use branches for experimentation**

---

## Platform Deployment

**Cursor:** Files stay as JSON, agents read via file system  
**Claude Projects:** Upload to Project Knowledge  
**AWS Bedrock:** Ingest into Bedrock Knowledge Base  
**Self-hosted:** Your storage mechanism

---

## Knowledge Base Quality & Optimization

**For schema improvements and data architecture optimization:**

Use the specialized knowledge base improvement prompt:
- **File:** `user_prompts/self_improvement/improve_knowledge_base_architecture.user.prompt.md`
- **Purpose:** Enterprise-grade schema design, data modeling, and LLM optimization
- **Authority:** Principal Knowledge Engineer standards (CTO/AI researcher approved)
- **When to use:** Quarterly reviews, before releases, schema confusion
- **Agent to use:** Optimization Agent or Architecture Agent

This prompt enforces best practices for:
- Data modeling and schema design
- LLM-friendly structures
- Data governance and quality
- Knowledge representation
- Enterprise standards compliance

---

## Troubleshooting

**Agent can't find files:**  
→ Run from repository root, check paths: `knowledge_base/[file].json`

**JSON parsing errors:**  
→ Validate at jsonlint.com or use `python -m json.tool`

**Missing required fields:**  
→ Run appropriate agent to populate (don't manually fill)

**Conflicts between files:**  
→ user_requirements is source of truth for WHAT/WHY  
→ design_decisions is source of truth for HOW/HOW MUCH

**Schema quality concerns:**  
→ Use `@improve_knowledge_base_architecture.user.prompt.md` for systematic improvements

---

## Summary

**Knowledge base = Shared memory across agents**

- `system_config.json` - Your project configuration (you manage)
- `user_requirements.json` - What to build (Requirements Agent writes)
- `design_decisions.json` - How to build it (Architecture Agent writes)

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Consistency across workflow
- ✅ No information loss between agents
- ✅ Traceability (requirements → design → implementation)
- ✅ Version history (git tracks changes)
- ✅ Schema validation (formal contracts and IDE support)

---

## JSON Schema Validation

**Purpose:** Formal schemas enable automated validation and better IDE support

**Schema Files (in `knowledge_base/schemas/`):**
- `system_config.schema.json` - Validates system configuration structure
- `user_requirements.schema.json` - Validates requirements format
- `design_decisions.schema.json` - Validates architecture decisions

**💡 Schemas Are the Documentation**: The JSON Schema files are human-readable and self-documenting. Each field includes descriptions, types, constraints, and examples. Read the schema files directly to understand the data structures—they're the authoritative source of truth for what fields exist, what they mean, and what values are valid.

**Using Schemas:**

**In VS Code / Cursor:**
- Schemas provide autocomplete and inline validation
- Hover over fields for documentation
- Errors highlighted in real-time

**Command-Line Validation:**

```bash
# Install JSON schema validator (if needed)
npm install -g ajv-cli

# Validate system_config.json
ajv validate -s knowledge_base/schemas/system_config.schema.json -d knowledge_base/system_config.json

# Validate user_requirements.json  
ajv validate -s knowledge_base/schemas/user_requirements.schema.json -d knowledge_base/user_requirements.json

# Validate design_decisions.json
ajv validate -s knowledge_base/schemas/design_decisions.schema.json -d knowledge_base/design_decisions.json
```

**Python Validation:**

```python
import json
import jsonschema

def validate_knowledge_base_file(data_file: str, schema_file: str):
    """Validate JSON file against schema."""
    with open(schema_file) as f:
        schema = json.load(f)
    with open(data_file) as f:
        data = json.load(f)
    
    try:
        jsonschema.validate(instance=data, schema=schema)
        print(f"✅ {data_file} is valid")
    except jsonschema.exceptions.ValidationError as e:
        print(f"❌ {data_file} validation error: {e.message}")
        return False
    return True

# Usage:
validate_knowledge_base_file(
    "knowledge_base/system_config.json",
    "knowledge_base/schemas/system_config.schema.json"
)
```

**Benefits of Schema Validation:**
- Catch errors early (invalid enums, missing required fields, type mismatches)
- Self-documenting structure (schema describes expected format)
- IDE assistance (autocomplete, inline docs, error highlighting)
- Consistency enforcement across manual edits
