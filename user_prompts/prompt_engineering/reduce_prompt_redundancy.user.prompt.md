title: Reduce AI Prompt Redundancy
description: Analyze and directly optimize AI prompt files to eliminate redundancy and improve token efficiency
usage: Send this user prompt TO your Cursor/Copilot Prompt Engineering Agent agent along with the prompt file you want to optimize
execution_context: This is a task instruction for the agent running IN Cursor, helping you optimize a single prompt file
---

## Usage Instructions

**How to use this user prompt**:
1. Open Cursor AI Pane with Prompt Engineering Agent mode active
2. Attach or mention this file in your chat
3. Attach the prompt file you want to optimize (or use currently open file)
4. Optionally specify token reduction goals
5. The agent will eliminate redundancies while preserving functionality

**What this does**: Instructs the Cursor agent to analyze and optimize a single prompt file

**What you get**: Optimized prompt with reduced redundancy, ready for deployment to any platform

## Mission

Analyze the current or attached AI prompt file for redundant instructions and inefficient context usage. Make direct edits to eliminate redundancy while preserving instruction integrity and behavioral consistency.

**Optional Targets:**

- Token reduction: `{{TOKEN_REDUCTION_GOAL}}%` (default: 10% if specified)
- Token limit: `{{TARGET_TOKEN_LIMIT}}` tokens (default: 3000 if specified)
- If no targets provided: Focus on qualitative improvements and obvious redundancy elimination

## Target Redundancy Patterns

- **Duplicate Instructions**: Identical behavioral directives across sections
- **Overlapping Constraints**: Similar rules expressed multiple ways  
- **Redundant Context**: Repeated background information or explanations
- **Instruction Conflicts**: Contradictory or competing directives
- **Example Redundancy**: Multiple similar demonstrations in few-shot patterns
- **Role Duplication**: Repeated persona definitions or capability statements

## Optimization Workflow

### 1. Scan and Prioritize

- Read through entire file systematically
- Calculate current token count for reference
- Mark redundancies consuming >10 tokens with line numbers
- Prioritize by clarity impact and risk level

**Target Setting:**

- **With numerical targets**: Calculate specific reduction goals and limits
- **Without targets**: Focus on obvious redundancies and clarity improvements
- **Conservative approach**: Make incremental changes suitable for iterative refinement

### 2. Execute by Priority

**Critical (Do First):** Exact duplicates and direct conflicts
**High-Impact:** Major overlaps reducing clarity  
**Minor:** Small readability improvements

**Actions:**

- **Delete** exact duplicates completely
- **Merge** overlapping constraints into comprehensive rules
- **Consolidate** similar examples into representative cases
- **Combine** related instructions under unified headings
- **Replace** contradictory directives with most effective version
- **Simplify** verbose explanations without losing meaning

### 3. Validate and Stop

- Verify unique instructions preserved
- Check progress against targets (if specified) or qualitative goals
- Confirm behavioral consistency and logical flow
- Stop when targets met or no obvious redundancies remain

## Implementation Approach

**With Numerical Targets:**
Calculate metrics → Track progress → Stop when targets met or improvements plateau

**Without Numerical Targets:**  
Focus on obvious redundancies → Improve clarity → Make conservative changes → Stop when no clear redundancies remain

**Universal Principles:**

- Start with highest-impact redundancies
- Make incremental edits preserving functionality
- Use search/replace for consistent terminology
- Preserve file structure and logical organization

## Critical Constraints

- **Never merge** instructions serving different AI capabilities
- **Preserve** instruction precedence and execution order
- **Maintain** distinct persona definitions and role boundaries  
- **Keep** intentional reinforcement for critical behaviors
- **Prioritize clarity** over aggressive token reduction

## Success Criteria

**Quantitative (when targets specified):**

- Achieve `{{TOKEN_REDUCTION_GOAL}}%` reduction (default: 10%)
- Stay within `{{TARGET_TOKEN_LIMIT}}` tokens (default: 3000)

**Qualitative (always applicable):**

- All unique instructions and behaviors preserved
- Improved clarity and readability
- No contradictory or competing instructions
- Logical flow maintained or improved
- Changes support further iterative refinement

**Approach Summary:**

- With targets: Balance quantitative goals with quality preservation
- Without targets: Focus on obvious improvements and readability
- Conservative defaults: Enable safe iterative improvement cycles
