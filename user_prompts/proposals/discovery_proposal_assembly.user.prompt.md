# Discovery/Assessment Proposal Assembly - User Prompt

**Phase:** Post-Requirements or Early Architecture  
**Purpose:** Assemble proposal for discovery/technical assessment project (2-6 weeks)  
**Agent:** Architecture Agent  
**Inputs:** `knowledge_base/user_requirements.json`, partial `knowledge_base/design_decisions.json`  
**Output:** Discovery proposal document

---

## Purpose

Assemble a proposal for a time-boxed discovery or technical assessment project that validates feasibility before committing to full implementation.

**When to use:**
- Significant technical uncertainty exists
- Want to validate approach before full investment
- Need to assess data quality, integration complexity, or performance feasibility
- De-risk a large project through upfront research
- Prove business value before committing full budget

**Typical Projects:**
- Technical feasibility assessment (2-4 weeks)
- AI readiness evaluation (2-6 weeks)
- Integration complexity analysis (2-4 weeks)
- Technology evaluation (compare 3 options, 3-4 weeks)
- Performance validation (can we meet latency/accuracy requirements, 2-3 weeks)

**Prerequisites:**
- ✅ `knowledge_base/user_requirements.json` complete (know what problem to solve)
- ⏳ `knowledge_base/design_decisions.json` partial (preliminary architecture approach)

---

## Instructions for Architecture Agent

### Step 1: Define Discovery Objectives

```
<thinking>
From user_requirements.json:
- What problem are we solving?
- What's uncertain or risky?
- What do we need to validate before full implementation?

Critical questions this discovery should answer:
1. [Question 1 based on requirements]
2. [Question 2 based on uncertainty]
3. [Question 3 based on technical risk]
</thinking>

**Discovery Objectives Identified:**

Based on requirements, this assessment will answer:

1. **[Primary Question]**  
   - Why critical: [Impact on full project]
   - Success criteria: [What answer is acceptable]

2. **[Secondary Question]**  
   [Same structure...]

3. **[Tertiary Question]**  
   [Same structure...]
```

---

### Step 2: Read from Knowledge Base

**Load:**
- `knowledge_base/user_requirements.json` (problem, business case)
- `knowledge_base/system_config.json` (constraints, budget)
- `knowledge_base/design_decisions.json` (if preliminary architecture exists)

## Assessment Approach

### Methodology

**Phase 1: Research & Planning (Days 1-3)**
- Review existing systems and data
- Identify similar implementations
- Define evaluation criteria
- Plan experiments and tests

**Phase 2: Technical Investigation (Days 4-15)**
- Data quality analysis
- Proof-of-concept development
- Performance testing
- Integration complexity assessment
- Technology evaluation

**Phase 3: Analysis & Recommendation (Days 16-[END])**
- Consolidate findings
- Develop recommendations
- Estimate effort for full implementation if GO
- Document risks and mitigation strategies

---

### Deliverables

**1. Assessment Report**
   - Executive summary of findings
   - Answers to each primary question
   - Data analysis results
   - Technical feasibility assessment
   - Risk analysis

**2. Technical Recommendation**
   - Recommended approach (if GO)
   - Technology stack recommendation
   - Architecture sketch
   - Integration strategy

**3. Implementation Plan** (if GO recommendation)
