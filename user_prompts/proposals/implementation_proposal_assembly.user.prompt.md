# Implementation Proposal Assembly - User Prompt

**Phase:** Post-Architecture (after design complete, before engineering)  
**Purpose:** Assemble executive proposal for POC/MVP implementation  
**Agent:** Architecture Agent  
**Inputs:** `knowledge_base/user_requirements.json`, `knowledge_base/design_decisions.json`  
**Output:** Executive proposal document

---

## Purpose

Assemble a comprehensive implementation proposal for executive approval by READING from the knowledge base (not redoing architecture work). This proposal enables business leaders to make go/no-go decisions on prototype development.

**When to use:**
- After Architecture Agent has completed all 6 design steps
- Before Engineering Agent begins prototype development
- Need executive/leadership approval for development investment
- Ready to present technical plan to decision-makers

**Prerequisites:**
- ✅ `knowledge_base/user_requirements.json` complete
- ✅ `knowledge_base/design_decisions.json` complete (all 6 steps)
- ✅ Architecture diagram generated
- ✅ Cost estimates calculated

---

## Instructions for Architecture Agent

When user requests implementation proposal, execute this assembly process:

### Step 1: Validate Prerequisites

```
<thinking>
Checking knowledge base completeness:
1. user_requirements.json exists? → [Yes/No]
2. design_decisions.json exists? → [Yes/No]
3. All 6 design steps complete? → [Check _metadata.steps_completed]
4. Executive summary populated? → [Yes/No]

If incomplete: Identify missing steps and recommend completing them first.
If complete: Proceed with assembly.
</thinking>

✅ Knowledge base validated - all prerequisites met.

Assembling implementation proposal...
```

**If incomplete:**
```
⚠️ Cannot assemble proposal - missing architecture decisions

**Missing:**
- [Step X not complete]: Run user_prompts/architecture/[prompt].user.prompt.md
- [Section Y missing]: Complete via Architecture Agent

**Required for proposal:**
- Complete tech stack selection
- Architecture diagram generated
- Team composition defined
- LOE estimates calculated
- Cost projections complete
- Project plan created

Please complete these steps, then return here for proposal assembly.
```

---

### Step 2: Read from Knowledge Base

**Load data from:**
- `knowledge_base/user_requirements.json`
- `knowledge_base/design_decisions.json`  
- `knowledge_base/system_config.json`

**Extract:**
```
<thinking>
From user_requirements.json:
- Problem statement
- Business value and ROI
- Success metrics
- Stakeholder information
- Risks

From design_decisions.json:
- Executive summary (go/no-go recommendation)
- Tech stack with rationale
- Architecture diagram
- Team composition
- LOE estimates (timeline, hours, complexity)
- Cost projections (development, infrastructure, TCO)
- Project plan (phased roadmap, milestones)
- Risks and mitigation strategies

From system_config.json:
- Decision makers (who needs to approve)
- Budget constraints
- Timeline constraints
- Strategic priority
</thinking>
```

## Notes for Architecture Agent

**This is a USER PROMPT for assembly only. Do NOT:**
- Re-do tech stack selection (READ from design_decisions.json)
- Re-calculate costs (READ from design_decisions.json)
- Re-estimate timeline (READ from design_decisions.json)
- Redesign architecture (READ from design_decisions.json)

**Do:**
- READ all data from knowledge base
- ASSEMBLE into executive proposal format
- ADD proposal-specific content (approval section, decision framework)
- TRANSLATE technical details to business impact where needed
- FORMAT for dual-audience (executive summary + technical appendices)

**Focus:** Assembly, translation, and presentation—not re-analysis.

**Version:** 0.1  
**Purpose:** Assembly-only proposal generation from knowledge base
