5. [e.g., Maintainability - long-term support]

Please provide:
1. **Recommended technology stack** with detailed rationale for each choice
2. **Alternative options** with trade-offs analysis (pros/cons)
3. **Cost breakdown** for each stack option (development + infrastructure)
4. **Team readiness assessment** - learning curve and training needs
5. **Risk analysis** - technical risks for each option
6. **Migration/scaling path** - how to evolve from MVP to production scale
7. **Decision matrix** - comparison table across key criteria
