# Self-Improvement User Prompts

**Purpose:** Prompts for improving the agents within the Multi-Agent AI Development Framework repository itself.

---

## Overview

This directory contains specialized user prompts that instruct agents to improve the agents and systems **in this repository**. These are self-referential improvement tasks where the framework improves itself.

**📖 Read the Prompts**: Each improvement prompt in this directory is self-documenting with clear objectives, execution steps, and validation criteria. Read the prompt file directly before using it—the YAML frontmatter and structured sections explain exactly what will be improved and how. Like reviewing code before running it, understand the improvement strategy first.

**Key Distinction:** These prompts improve THIS repository's agents, not external AI systems or generic prompts.

---

## When to Use These Prompts

Use prompts in this directory when you want to:

- Improve a specific agent in this framework (Requirements, Architecture, Engineering, Deployment, Optimization, Supervisor)
- Conduct system-wide optimization of the entire Multi-Agent AI Development Framework
- Apply latest research findings to agents in this repo
- Prepare for framework releases with quality improvements
- Fix issues identified in agents

**Do NOT use these for:**
- Optimizing external AI systems (use Optimization Agent directly)
- Creating/improving prompts for other projects (use `prompt_engineering/` directory)
- General development tasks (use appropriate agent directly)

## How to Use Self-Improvement Prompts

### General Workflow

1. **Identify Need**: Determine which agent or system needs improvement
2. **Select Prompt**: Choose appropriate improvement prompt from this directory
3. **Load Agent**: Typically use Prompt Engineering Agent or Optimization Agent
4. **Execute**: Reference the improvement prompt (e.g., `@improve_requirements_agent.user.prompt.md`)
5. **Review**: Examine proposed changes and validation results
6. **Apply**: Implement approved improvements
7. **Test**: Validate that improvements work as expected
8. **Document**: Update changelogs and version numbers

### Best Practices

**Frequency:**
- System-wide: Quarterly or after 5+ projects
- Individual agents: As needed based on issues or bi-annually
- After major research updates or framework changes

**Validation:**
- Always test improved agents on sample tasks
- Verify backward compatibility (existing workflows still work)
- Check cross-references remain valid
- Validate knowledge base integration

**Safety:**
- Use fresh sessions for self-improvement (avoids recursion)
- Review changes before committing
- Test incrementally
- Keep backups for rollback

## Integration with Other Components

### Relationship to Optimization Agent

The **Optimization Agent** (`ai_agents/optimization_agent.system.prompt.md`) is the primary agent used for system-wide improvements. The prompts in this directory provide detailed instructions on WHAT to improve and WHERE, while the Optimization Agent defines HOW to optimize (methodology, assessment framework, validation protocols).

**Example integration:**
```
Optimization Agent + improve_ai_engineering_assistant.user.prompt.md
= Complete system optimization of this repository
```

### Relationship to Prompt Engineering

These prompts leverage the **Prompt Engineering Agent** for applying prompt engineering best practices to agent system prompts. The improvement prompts use the assistant's 4-step methodology (Research → Test → Enhance → Confirm).

---

## Recursion Prevention

**Critical:** Some prompts in this directory improve agents that may be used to execute the improvements. This creates potential for infinite loops.

**Built-in safeguards:**
- Iteration tracking (MAX_ITERATIONS enforced)
- Fresh session requirements
- Recursion detection logic
- Clear completion criteria

**User responsibility:**
- Start with fresh conversation for self-improvement
- Do not chain multiple self-improvement cycles
- Review recursion guardrails in each prompt

---

## File Naming Convention

All files in this directory follow the pattern:
```
improve_<agent_name>.user.prompt.md
```

Where `<agent_name>` or `<component>` is:
- `ai_engineering_assistant` (entire system)
- `knowledge_base_architecture` (data models and schemas)
- `supervisor_agent`
- `requirements_agent`
- `architecture_agent`
- `engineering_agent`
- `deployment_agent`
- `optimization_agent`
- `prompt_engineering_agent`

This clearly indicates these prompts improve agents and systems **in this repository**.

## Contributing

When adding new self-improvement prompts:

1. **Follow naming convention**: `improve_<target>.user.prompt.md`
2. **Include recursion prevention**: If prompt improves itself or orchestrating agent
3. **Document focus areas**: What specifically will be improved
4. **Define success criteria**: How to measure improvement
5. **Provide validation plan**: How to test improvements
6. **Update this README**: Add new prompt to appropriate section

## Migration History

**October 2025 Migration:**
- Created `self_improvement/` directory
- Moved all `improve_*_agent.user.prompt.md` files from `user_prompts/optimization/`
- Rationale: Clarify distinction between system optimization (Optimization Agent) and agent improvement (self-improvement prompts)
- All 7 prompts moved, `optimization/` directory removed
- Cross-references updated in subsequent commits

---
