# Extract Requirements from Notes - User Prompt

**Phase:** Requirements Discovery  
**Duration:** 30-60 minutes  
**Best for:** Post-meeting requirements structuring  
**Agent:** Requirements Agent  
**Input:** Unstructured meeting notes, emails, transcripts  
**Output:** `knowledge_base/user_requirements.json`

---

## Purpose

Parse unstructured meeting notes, email threads, or conversation transcripts into structured requirements following the user_requirements.json schema.

**When to use:**
- After stakeholder discovery sessions or requirements meetings
- Have scattered notes that need organization
- Before creating project proposals or technical designs
- Transitioning from informal notes to formal requirements

**Prerequisites:** Meeting notes, email threads, Slack conversations, or transcripts

---

## Instructions for Requirements Agent

When a user provides unstructured notes, execute this extraction process:

### Step 1: Load and Review Notes

```
Thank you for sharing these notes. I'll parse them into a structured requirements document.

**What I'll do:**
1. Extract key information across all requirement categories
2. Structure according to user_requirements.json schema
3. Flag missing information with "[TO BE DETERMINED]"
4. Recommend follow-up questions

**This will take a few minutes. Processing...**
```

---

### Step 2: Systematic Extraction

**Parse notes and extract information for each category:**

**DO NOT fabricate information.** Only extract what is explicitly stated or clearly implied.

#### Extract: Customer/Organization Context

**Look for:**
- Company name, industry, size
- Business model
- Market position
- AI experience/maturity

**If found in notes:** Populate `customer` section  
**If not found:** Mark "[TO BE DETERMINED]"

---

#### Extract: Use Case & Problem Statement

**Look for:**

- Current pain points
- Desired outcomes
- Target users

**Map to:**
- `use_case.title`, `use_case.summary`, `use_case.problem_statement`

- `business.desired_outcome`

---

#### Extract: Current State & Workflows

**Look for:**

---

#### Extract: Business Value & Success Metrics

**Look for:**
- Expected ROI or time savings
- Cost reduction opportunities
- Strategic importance
- Success criteria
- KPIs mentioned

**Map to:**
- `business.business_value` (all subsections)
- `business.success_metrics.kpis`
- `financial.expected_roi`

---

#### Extract: Technical Requirements

**Look for:**

- Phased approach mentions
- What's in/out of scope

**Map to:**
- `project_scope.timeline_estimate_weeks`
- `constraints.timeline.deadline` (in system_config)
- `project_scope.phased_approach`

---

#### Extract: Risks & Concerns

**Look for:**
- Stakeholder concerns about AI
- Technical risks mentioned
- Business risks
- Dependencies

**Map to:**
- `risks.business_risks`
- `risks.technical_risks`
- `risks.assumptions`

---

### Step 3: Identify Gaps

**After extraction, analyze completeness:**

```
<thinking>
Required for architecture design:
✓ Problem statement clear
✓ Current process documented
✗ Performance requirements missing
✗ Data volume unclear
✗ Integration details incomplete

Completeness score: PARTIAL

Critical gaps:
1. [Gap 1]
2. [Gap 2]

Optional gaps (can be gathered later):
1. [Gap 3]
</thinking>
```

**Generate gap analysis:**

```markdown
## Missing Information (Critical for Architecture)

**High Priority (need before architecture design):**
1. **[Missing Item 1]**
   - Why needed: [Impact on architecture]
   - Suggested question: "[Question to ask stakeholder]"

2. **[Missing Item 2]**
   - Why needed: [Impact on architecture]
   - Suggested question: "[Question to ask stakeholder]"

**Medium Priority (Architecture Agent can gather during design):**

   - Can be determined during: [Which architecture step]

**Optional (Nice to have):**
1. **[Missing Item 4]**

## Example: Extracting from Financial Operations Meeting Notes

**Input (sample notes):**

```
Meeting with John (solo entrepreneur, consulting business)
Date: 2025-10-01

Pain points:
- Spends WAY too much time on invoicing - about 2 hrs/week
- Manual expense tracking in Excel is killing him - 3 hrs/week
- Monthly financial reports take 5 hours to compile
- Uses QuickBooks for invoicing but it's manual entry
- Takes photos of receipts but then has to categorize manually
- Pulls data from QB, Excel, and email into monthly P&L reports

Tech level: Comfortable with basic software, not a developer (6/10)

Timeline: Would like this working in next quarter (Q1 2026)

Budget: Willing to invest $50K-75K if ROI is clear

Success = spending <2 hrs/week on financial admin instead of 10 hrs

Tools: QuickBooks Self-Employed, Excel, Gmail
```

**Extracted requirements:**
