## Example: Financial Operations Assistant (Primary Example)

**Scenario:** Solo-entrepreneur spending 10 hours/week on invoicing, expense tracking, and financial reporting.

### Sample 10-Question Flow

**Q1: What problem are you trying to solve with AI?**
> "I spend way too much time on financial admin—invoicing, tracking expenses, and creating monthly reports. It's taking 10+ hours every week away from client work."

```
<thinking>
Problem: Financial administration workload
Initial assessment: HIGH priority (repetitive, digital, time-consuming)
</thinking>
```

---

**Q2: How do you handle this today?**
> "I use QuickBooks for invoicing (manual entry), take photos of receipts then manually categorize in Excel, and compile monthly P&L reports by pulling data from multiple sources into Excel templates."

```
<thinking>
Tools: QuickBooks, Excel, manual processes
Pattern emerging: Document generation + data processing
Multiple disconnected tools = integration opportunity
</thinking>
```

---

**Q3: How often does this happen, and how much time does it take?**
> "Invoicing: 2 hours/week. Expenses: 3 hours/week. Monthly reports: 5 hours once a month. Total about 10 hours/week average."

```
<thinking>
10 hrs/week × 50 weeks = 500 hrs/year
At $100-200/hr billable rate = $50K-$100K opportunity cost
Classification: HIGH priority (>5 hrs/week threshold)
</thinking>

🔴 PAIN POINT IDENTIFIED: Financial operations (10 hrs/week = 500 hrs/year)
Significant opportunity for automation!
```

---

[Continue through all 10 questions...]

**Q10: What does success look like?**
> "Success means spending <2 hours/week on financial admin instead of 10. Monthly reports generated automatically in minutes instead of hours. Accurate expense categorization without manual work. More time for billable client work."

```
<thinking>
Success metrics clear:
- Time: 10 hrs/week → <2 hrs/week (80% reduction)
- Monthly reports: 5 hours → <15 minutes
- Quality: Accurate categorization (>95%)
User knows what they want = COMPLETE requirements for this scope
</thinking>
```

---

### Generated Output

```markdown
# 🎯 Your AI Architecture Plan - Financial Operations Assistant

## Problem Summary

**What you're solving:** Automating 10 hours/week of routine financial administration (invoicing, expense tracking, monthly reporting) for a solo-entrepreneur.

**Current state:** Manual processes across QuickBooks, Excel, and email consuming 500 hours/year that could be spent on billable client work.

**AI Suitability: 🔴 HIGH Priority** - Excellent fit for AI automation

**Rationale:**
- Digital, computer-based tasks (invoicing, spreadsheets, documents)
- Highly repetitive (same process weekly/monthly)
- Structured data and clear rules (financial transactions follow patterns)
- Significant time impact (10 hrs/week = 500 hrs/year)
- Clear templates exist (invoice formats, expense categories, report structures)

**Expected Impact:**
- **Time savings:** 8 hours/week → 400 hours/year
- **Value:** $60,000/year (at $150/hr billable rate - opportunity cost eliminated)
- **Quality improvement:** Consistent categorization, fewer errors, real-time insights
- **Capacity gain:** 400 hours freed up for revenue-generating client work

**Business Case:**
- Investment: $50K-$75K development + $200/month operations
- Payback: <12 months
- ROI: 80-120% in Year 1, 300-400% over 3 years

## Recommended Solution

### Primary Approach: Multi-Agent Financial Operations System

**Pattern:** Multi-Agent System (2 specialized agents)

**Why this pattern:**
You have two distinct problem domains that benefit from specialization:
1. **Operations** (invoicing, expense tracking) - Transactional, frequent, rule-based
2. **Analytics** (reporting, forecasting) - Analytical, periodic, insight-driven

Separating these into specialized agents gives you:
- Better performance (each agent optimized for its domain)
- Lower costs (use cheaper models for simple operations, premium for complex analytics)
- Easier improvement (update one agent without affecting the other)

**How it works:**

**Agent 1: Financial Operations Agent**
1. Receives project data (hours, rate, client) → Generates professional invoice
2. Receives expense data (receipt photo/text) → Categorizes using IRS business rules
3. Tracks transactions → Stores in shared knowledge base

**Agent 2: Analytics & Reporting Agent**
1. Reads transaction data from knowledge base
2. Generates monthly P&L, cash flow statements
3. Identifies trends and provides forecasts
4. Delivers actionable financial insights

**Coordination:**
- Shared knowledge base (local JSON/SQLite)
- Operations Agent writes transactions
- Analytics Agent reads and analyzes
- User interacts with either agent based on task

**Example from the framework:**
→ See: `docs/agent_design_patterns.md` - Multi-Agent Coordinator pattern
→ Reference: Similar to [financial-assistant-for-families](https://github.com/Modular-Earth-LLC/financial-assistant-for-families) but with better separation of concerns

## Technology Recommendations

**LLM Platform:** Claude Sonnet 3.5 (Anthropic)
- **Reason:** 
  - Excellent at financial analysis and structured data processing
  - Strong at maintaining professional tone for invoices
  - Reliable for rule-based categorization (IRS expense categories)
  - Good balance of quality and cost
- **Cost estimate:** $100-150/month
  - Invoicing: 20 invoices/month × ~2K tokens = 40K tokens
  - Expenses: 50 expenses/month × ~1K tokens = 50K tokens
  - Reports: 1 report/month × ~10K tokens = 10K tokens
  - Total: ~100K tokens/month × $3/million = $0.30 + overhead ≈ $100-150/month
- **Cost optimization:** Use Claude Haiku for simple expense categorization (60% cost reduction)

**Development Stack:** Python + Streamlit
- **Reason:**
  - Python: Excellent for financial calculations, data processing, CSV/JSON handling
  - Streamlit: Fastest path to functional UI for non-technical users
  - LangChain (optional): If need complex agent orchestration
- **Learning curve:** Low (if team knows Python) / Moderate (if new to Python)
- **Timeline advantage:** 30% faster than building custom web app

**Integration Approach:** Hybrid (Phase 1: CSV, Phase 2: API)
- **Phase 1 (MVP):** 
  - QuickBooks: CSV export upload (simple, works immediately)
  - Email: Gmail API for sending invoices (well-documented)
  - Receipts: Text entry or photo OCR (Anthropic vision API)
- **Phase 2 (Enhancement):**
  - QuickBooks API: Direct integration (after MVP validates value)

  - Week 1: Setup, agent prompts, basic invoicing
  - Week 2: Expense categorization, data storage
  - Week 3: Monthly reports, UI
  - Week 4: Testing, refinement, documentation
- **Phase 2 (API Integration - 2 weeks):**
  - QuickBooks API integration
  - Enhanced features based on MVP feedback
